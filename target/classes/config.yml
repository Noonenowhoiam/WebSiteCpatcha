# WebsiteCaptcha Plugin Configuration
# ==========================
# This configuration ensures players complete a CAPTCHA on a designated website
# before accessing the server. Players are temporarily placed in a virtual
# lobby and prompted to verify. Once verified, they can proceed to the main server.

# --------------------------
# Web Server Configuration
# --------------------------
# Configuration for the verification web server. Ensure the port is open if hosting externally.
Web:
  # Host Address:
  # 1. This option specifies the address used in the verification link sent to players upon joining.
  #    - Use the server's public IP address (e.g., "148.113.6.42") for external access.
  #    - Alternatively, use a domain name (e.g., "verify.yourserver.com") if configured with DNS.
  # 2. Why it's important:
  #    - The host value is included in the verification link (e.g., "http://<host>:<port>/captcha?uuid=<playerUUID>").
  #    - Players must be able to access this link from their devices to complete verification.
  #    - If set to "localhost" or left empty, the link will only work for players on the same machine as the server.
  # 3. Local Hosting:
  #    - For players on the same network, use the server's local IP (e.g., "192.168.x.x").
  #    - Example link: "http://192.168.1.100:27064/captcha".
  # 4. External Hosting:
  #    - For players connecting externally, use the server's public IP or a domain name.
  #    - Ensure the specified port (below) is open in your firewall and router or cloud provider's security group.
  # 5. Note:
  #    - The server binds to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) by default, so this host value is used only for generating the verification link, not for server binding.
  #    - If not configured, the default value is "localhost", which will not work for external players.
  host: ""
  # Port Configuration:
  # 1. Specify the port number for the web server:
  #    - Default: 8080
  #    - You can use any available port (e.g., 9090, 2020, etc.).
  # 2. Why this is important:
  #    - The port must be open and accessible for the verification website to function.
  #    - Players will receive a link in the format: "http://<host>:<port>". Ensure the port is correct and accessible.
  # 3. Hosting Notes:
  #    - If you're hosting the server locally, ensure the port is not used by other services.
  #    - For external hosting, ensure the port is open in your firewall and router. Use command /webcaptcha portcheck <ip> <port> to verify that the port is open.
  # 4. Examples:
  #    - Local setup: port: 8080 (access via http://192.168.x.x:8080).
  #    - External setup: port: 9090 (access via http://verify.yourserver.com:9090).
  port: 8080

# reCAPTCHA Configuration

  # Site key for identifying your website to the reCAPTCHA service.
  # Obtain this key from the Google reCAPTCHA admin console.
  site_key: ""

  # Secret key for secure server-side communication with the reCAPTCHA service.
